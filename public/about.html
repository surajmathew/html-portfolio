<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a Lead Business Consultant at VMware, 
  I contribute to the Enterprise Data Office with a specific focus on 
  Master Data Management, Enterprise Data Quality and Data Governance. 
  I leverage my MBA, Post Graduate Program in Data Science and Business Analytics, and Master of Technology 
  in Software Development and Management to connect people, processes, data, and 
  technology in the most efficient and client-centric way. I help business functions generate more revenue, 
  identify areas of investment, isolate redundancies and automate processes.

<p>With over 13 years of experience in consulting, business analysis, business development, 
  software and product development, product and project management, and analytics across BFSI, 
  Healthcare, and Life Sciences domains, I have built, managed, and led cross-functional
   high-performance teams on various strategic and operational initiatives. I have built 
   analytical and automated solutions, managed software products, and led regulatory and 
   policy driven projects for clients and stakeholders in Wells Fargo, Standard Chartered, 
   and Cognizant. I have also drafted and presented proposals to win multi-year, 
   million-dollar deals with US clients.
</p>

<p>I am passionate about solving customer and stakeholder problems, and I love to mentor 
  and share my insights with people around me to help them grow in their aspirations and 
  learn from their experiences. I am an adaptive and proactive learner who can deliver 
  value quickly and effectively. Some of my competencies include people management, 
  project management, product management and development, client and stakeholder management,
   process re-engineering, agile, branding, design thinking, UI/UX/CX, business development,
    business and data analysis, and automation. I am proficient in various business intelligence 
    tools and programming languages, such as Alteryx, Paxata, Tableau, KNIME, Microsoft Office Suite,
     Python for Data Science, SQL, PL/SQL, Oracle Forms, Oracle Reports, Java, UNIX and VBA. 
     My interests and research areas are around data quality, data governance, model building, 
     data literacy, and data democratization.
